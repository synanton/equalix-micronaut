/**
 * Bounded retry for scheduler ticks aborted by lock contention (P1). Concurrent ticks take
 * row locks in deterministic order (see {@code DispatcherService}), so a deadlock cycle
 * cannot form between same-shape ticks — but residual cross-shape races (e.g. calculator
 * virtual-time-then-tasks vs dispatcher tasks-then-virtual-time) can still lose a deadlock
 * lottery (PostgreSQL 40P01) or a lock wait (55P03), both surfacing as
 * {@link LockAcquisitionException}. Those ticks are idempotent (re-selection sees the same
 * backlog), so retrying the whole tick is safe; the next scheduled tick is the final
 * backstop either way.
 *
 * <p>Only lock-acquisition failures retry here. Optimistic conflicts surface as rowcount
 * mismatches handled by the services themselves, and business failures must never retry.
